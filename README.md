# Big Data & AI Case Compeition

## About this Project
This project is a submission to the Big Data & AI competition hosted by the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and [Scotiabank](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal.html). The goal of the competition being to help identify Human Trafficking in Canada. We used a dataset of canadian etransfers over the course of a year. We used machine learning to identify clusters of potential human traffickers.
